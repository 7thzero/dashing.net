The dashboard itself is written with asp.net web api/mvc 4. \r\n\r\nWe have tried to re-use as much code as possible from dashing to preserve compatibility. Therefore most of the behaviours and conventions used in dashing.net should be identical or closely mirrored to dashing. All widget frontend files (html,scss and coffeescript) can be used directly. Jobs, however, need to be re-implemented with .net in-mind.\r\n\r\n[See an example of dashing.net running in Windows Azure](http://dashingdotnet.azurewebsites.net/)\r\n\r\n# License\r\nDistributed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/Shopify/dashing/blob/master/MIT-LICENSE)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
